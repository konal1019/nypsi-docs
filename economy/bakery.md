# bakery 
the bakery is a way to produce cookies and cakes.

## how it works
you need 1 furnance and 1 coal each time you bake. your furnace wont be used while baking but for every bake you need 1 coal.
if you want to bake do
```
$bake
```

## how do i bake more cookies?

you can increase your cookie production with cursor, supercursor and grandmas.

|item|effect|
|------|-------|
|cursor|+1 max cookie|
|supercursor|+1 min &  max cookie|
|grandmas|bakes 0.5 cookies each hour|
|oven|+1 hour of afk time|




to increase the afk time of your grandmas you can use ovens. if you have 12 ovens and you dont bake for 11 hours your grandmas still bake and stack up the cookies.

there are also 2 ways to double the output of cookies are the guild upgrade "double cookies" 0.5% for every upgrade. another way are gems like crystal heart (5%), white (2%), pink (0,5%) and blue (0,1%)

## how do i bake cakes?

there is only 1 way to get cakes.
if you use grandpas there is a chance of 0.5% to bake a cake. the percent chance doesnt stack up if you have more grandpas its only 0.5% each grandpa so the chance of getting more cakes varies according to the number of the grandpas.


## how do you get upgrades?

the upgrades like grandmas, grandpas, cursor, supercursor and ovens can you get them from different crates and scratch cards like basic_crate, 69420_crate, nypsi_crate, dailyscratchcards, luckyscratchcards.
